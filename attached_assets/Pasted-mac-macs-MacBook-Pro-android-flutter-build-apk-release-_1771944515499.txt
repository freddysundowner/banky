Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 35, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- sqflite_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- url_launcher_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /Users/mac/projects/projects/banky/mobile-app/android/app/build.gradle:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }
Font asset "MaterialIcons-Regular.otf" was tree-shaken, reducing it from 1645184 to 8732 bytes (99.5% reduction). Tree-shaking can be disabled by providing the --no-tree-shake-icons flag when building your app.

Execution failed for task ':app:checkReleaseAarMetadata'.

       1.  Dependency 'androidx.browser:browser:1.9.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 36 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled against android-35.

           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 36, for example 36.

           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).
